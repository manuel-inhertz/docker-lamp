## Why you shouldn't use this stack unmodified in production
We want to empower developers to quickly create creative Applications. Therefore we are providing an easy to set up a local development environment for several different Frameworks and PHP Versions. 
In Production you should modify at a minimum the following subjects:

* php handler: mod_php=> php-fpm
* secure mysql users with proper source IP limitations
